Revision history for WWW-Netflix-API

0.05	2008-10-21
	* added examples/catalog.pl -- pulls entire catalog down to catalog.xml.
	* added examples/search.pl -- uses the catalog api to search for a term.
	* added examples/catalog2db.pl -- converts catalog.xml to a SQLite database.
	* changed the content-related attributes/behavior.  Now is much more memory
		efficient. _set_content() takes and stored a scalar ref, so large
		(for example the catalog index) content is copied around. Also, the
		content_filter isn't used until the first invocation of content(),
		at which point the results are cached in the _filtered_content attribute.
	* t/attributes.t updated accordingly.
	* updated EXAMPLES pod.
	* updated ATTRIBUTES pod.
	* added t/rest2sugar.t to MANIFEST
